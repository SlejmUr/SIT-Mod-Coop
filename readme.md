## Info
The mod does the following:
- Adds extensions to JET to enable Friends, Groups & Fake-Matching (only useful if you share your server with others)
- Changes the difficulty and AI of Bots to be more difficult but fun
- Changes the location data to ensure Bot PMC spawn using "pmcBot" rather than artificially
- Changes the location data for Labs to make the PMC bots spawn as regular bots, not bosses (fixing laser beam cheat bots)
- Changes bot health data to ensure they all match your character's health rather than use an artificial boost
- Changes bot health head to 1 so that the player can kill AI easily with headshots when unarmoured
